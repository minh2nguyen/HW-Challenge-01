# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refractor

## Description 
This repository contains a refractored code for **Horisen**, a social solutions service website. 

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. Acessibilty also ensures the web is better postioned in search engines. 

These are the steps I took to improve the codebase for long-term sustatainability:

- Added HTML5 semantic elements 
- Fixed the link function in the navigation bar
- Added Alt attributes to the images 
- Made sure heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Organized and consolidated redundant CSS
- Included comments before each element/ section of the page
- Changed the title to be more despriptive
